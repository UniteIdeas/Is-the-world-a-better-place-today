# unmilleniumgoals

“Is the world a better place today?” (isWBPT) is a web-based, interactive visualization app based on the Millenium Develoment Goals data. This visualization for the people is designed to help users overcome three potential barriers, which are often overlooked in the design of visualizations and in the presentation of data: literacy barrier, interaction barrier and task barrier.

Due to file size limitation, the data_final_02.csv which the app uses has been zipped. 

To launch the app: 
* unzip this file,
* install all requirements in requirements.txt
* launch cherrypy app in manage.py
